Before classifying the sentences, from the simple grammer we can claim that:
1)If there is no prep phrase after subject, subject contains fname,fname fname,fpron,fn,fd fn. If there are prep phrases after subject, subject only contains fn and fd fn.
2)Object and object complement always contains fname,fname fname,fpron,fn,fd fn.
3)fv can always be replaced by faux fv except when faux is at the head of the sentence.
4)If there is a prep phrases in one position, this position can always add more prep phrases.

Sorts of sentences success to parse:
1.subject + fv
Example: john lives
2.subject + faux + fv
Example: buckaroo banzai is driving
3.subject + pp + fv
Example: the alien from chicago lives
4.subject + fv + pp
Example: he lives in chicago on earth
5.subject + fv + object
Example: john whorfin steals a watermelon
6.subject + pp + fv + object
Example: aliens from ten planet steal watermelons
7.subject + fv + object + pp
Example: aliens steal watermelons from ten planet to earth
8.subject + fv + object + object complement
Example: buckaroo banzai gives us a jetcar
9.subject + pp + fv + object + object complement
Example: aliens from planet give us a jetcar
10.subject + fv + object + object complement + pp
Example: buckaroo banzai gives us a jetcar from aliens
11.subject + fv + object + pp + object complement
Example: buckaroo banzai give john whorfin from chicago a watermelon
12.from 1 to 11(except 2),add faux at the head of sentence to change into a question sentence
Examples: does john live
          is he driving to chicago on earth
          does buckaroo banzai give us a jetcar
          do buckaroo banzai give john whorfin from chicago a watermelon
13.subject fis object
Example: buckaroo banzai is alien
14.subject pp fis object
Example: the alien on earth is buckaroo banzai
15.subject fis object pp
Example: it is the alien from planet

Types of sentences fail to parse:
1.subject + faux + pp
Example: she is from chicago
2.vp
Example: steal a watermelon
3.fname/fname fname + pp + fv + pp
Example: buckaroo banzai from planet is driving on earth
4.fd + fname + ...
Example: this planet + ...
5.fd + faux + fd + fn
Example: this is a watermelon

Improvements to grammar such that we can properly parse the failed sentences:
By adding following functionality:
0	s	vp
0	s	fd fis np
0	vbar	faux
0	nbar	fname
0	nbar	fname fname
And modifying:
0	nbar	fn nbar-mods  to  0	nbar	nbar nbar-mods
